# 🔐 EmojiCrypt — Encrypt Your Secrets With Emojis!

Welcome to **EmojiCrypt** — a completely unnecessary, 100% fun hobby project where encryption meets emojis.  
Built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Lucide React**, and deployed to the edge via **Cloudflare + OpenNext**.  
Why? Because regular encryption is boring and emojis are better.

## 🧠 But... Why?

- Because I wanted to build something stupidly fun 🧠✨  
- Because Next.js on Cloudflare is the new Vercel 🚫  
- Because using `bun` makes me feel faster than light ⚡  
- Because sharing secrets as 🤯🤗🥵 is peak software engineering  
- And because I had **ChatGPT as my pair programmer** 🤖

> Oh, and **Cursor** helped too — shoutout to the coolest code editor AI sidekick. 🧑‍💻💬
